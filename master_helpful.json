For example, you can have a notary help you when you sign documents or deeds to make sure that they are properly signed and witnessed.

The bank will give you conditions, such as a maximum loan-to-value ratio, and you\u2019ll have to pay a monthly service fee.

It\u2019s a little trickier than ordinary fried food, though, because tempeh is very dense. It tends to get greasy, so you can add oil to the frying pan, but the oil might turn your tempeh black. You\u2019ll probably want to oil the tempeh first, just to get the oil into the edges of it and to make it a bit more pliable. You also want to add some rice flour to the oil, and add the tempeh to the oil, so that the oil covers the tempeh. You can then start cooking the tempeh. When the tempeh is browned on one side, you can flip it. In the middle, the tempeh is usually a little uncooked, so be careful not to overcook it!<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>Fried tempeh is simply tempeh that has been dipped in flour and fried in oil.  To make it, first cut the tempeh into slices.  Then dip the slices into flour, shaking off any excess flour, and fry in hot oil, shaking off any excess oil.

        "### Instructions: How do I know if my house has a water leak?\n\n### Response:<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>You can go to your local water department and they can send an inspector to check your pipes and also look at your usage to see if there might be a problem. If you live in a house without a leaking faucet you can also check the toilet for bubbles, look in the sink to see if there is a leak, and to see if there are any dirty spots on your floors where water might be coming in.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>Hm, that\u2019s a hard one, but there are a few ways to go about this.  The easiest is to just check your water meter to see if it\u2019s showing any signs of leakage.  The meter will show a steady reading if your water usage is normal, but if it\u2019s showing signs of leakage, it will show an increasing reading even if your water usage is normal.  So just check the meter every day or so to see if it\u2019s showing any signs of leakage.\n\nAnother way is to just carefully watch your water bill.  If your water usage is normal, your water bill should be about the same every month.  But if you notice that your water bill is increasing, it might be time to investigate further.\n\nIf you do suspect a leak, the next step is to find out where the leak is coming from.  One way to do this is to turn off all the water appliances in your house and see if the leak stops.  Then you can start turning on the appliances one by one to see which one is causing the leak.  This might be a bit tedious, but it\u2019s the best way to find out which appliance is causing the leak.": "model",

        "### Instructions: Hi, I'd like to learn how to play racquetball. Can you explain the game to me?\n\n### Response:<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>Sure! A racquetball court is almost like a swimming pool: you\u2019re inside, with a net going around the side walls. Instead of swimming or floating, though, you\u2019re hitting a ball with a racquet. And instead of jumping and diving, you\u2019re leaping and slamming.\n\nThe game is a lot of fun! You have a racquet and the ball, and you\u2019re trying to keep the ball from hitting the walls or ceiling of the court. You can control the ball with your racquet, and also you can control it with your body.\n\nThe rules are pretty straightforward. You win the point when you hit the ball so that it passes through the square ring on the front wall of the court, called the \u201cfront wall string\u201d. If you miss that, you lose the point.\n\nThe game lasts for 11 points. In case of a tie, the players play an extra point.\n\nIn the picture above, the player in the blue jersey is serving the ball. The player in the black jersey is returning the ball.\n\nEach player starts with 2 balls. During each point, a player has 1 ball.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>Sure, racquetball is a sport played between two people (singles or doubles) in a court with a net.  Each player uses a racket to hit a ball (a rubber or plastic sphere) over the net.  The game consists of two courts, a service line and a net strung across the width of the court.  The game is played in two courts, with the players hitting the ball back and forth across the net.  The objective of the game is for a player to hit the ball so that it bounces more than once on the other side of the net, and thus forces the opponent to run more than once to retrieve the ball.  The length of a match can vary, but is typically played in two out of three games, or the first player to score 21 points, except when playing a \"gold medal match\" (a match for the championship of a tournament) or \"salon match\" (a casual match), which are usually played in three out of five games.": "equal",

The poem says something like, \u201cRow, row, row your boat gently down the stream,\u201d but the words are hard to understand. In the 1300s, the monk\u2019s head musicmaster took the poem and sang it to a tune that was already popular at the time, which is called \"Sumer is icumen in.\" He changed the poem by rhyming a lot of the words. The poem that he made was used in the \u201cLudus Coventriae\u201d music manuscript, which means that it was widely known at the time.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>The song probably originated in the 1790s, in the English colonies of North America, though it is now associated with the American songwriter and poet Edward Lear.

These cost about 20 dollars, and you can find them at some of the larger supermarkets.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>Home made ice cream is easy to make, and there are lots of different recipes you can follow.  I\u2019ll suggest a couple of different recipes, depending on what you want your flavor to be.  For example, you could make chocolate ice cream by mixing the following ingredients:\n\n-   1/4 cup of heavy cream\n-   1/4 cup of milk\n-   1/4 cup of sugar\n-   1/4 cup of cocoa powder\n-   1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract\n-   1/2 teaspoon of salt\n\nYou can put all of those ingredients into a bowl, and stir them until the sugar is dissolved.  Then, cover the bowl and let it sit in the fridge for at least 3 hours or overnight.  Once it\u2019s ready, take the bowl out of the fridge and beat with an electric mixer for about 2 minutes.  Then you can put the mixture into a suitable container and freeze it.  You can repeat this process using different flavors of extract and cocoa powder to make different flavors of ice cream.": "model",

By October 1957, the CDC estimated that that there were 63,000 cases of the disease in the United States, and 12,000 deaths.  That\u2019s a case fatality rate of about 19%, which is quite high.

Basically he said that because human beings are each on their own in a state of nature, without any authority to protect them, it\u2019s really important to create some kind of social structure, and that\u2019s what the social contract is for.  He saw that \u201chumans live together\u201d in the quote above, and by creating laws and government and government officials to enforce laws and agreements, society\u2019s members will, in effect, create this binding contract to protect and provide for each other.  He said the consent of the governed is the source of all political power, which is pretty easy to agree with since it seems logical to me that people who actually live in a society can better decide how to run their society than a random group of people who don\u2019t actually live in that society.  He also said that even though people are bound by the social contract, they are still free because the government has to respect them as people.  That said, the fact that a government can enforce laws pretty much means that the government has power, and government leaders have more power than others, so it\u2019s not really possible for everyone to be equal.  I think this was a problem for John Locke in the 18th century but I think today\u2019s political philosophy has gotten around it.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>John Locke was a British philosopher who published books on ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology. His book, \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\", is a classic text in the philosophy of knowledge and is widely used in introductory philosophy courses.

The cotton plant has to be harvested by hand, since it doesn\u2019t grow in areas that are easily accessible, and the plant doesn\u2019t produce cotton until a certain point, so the harvesting has to be timed.  The cotton fibers are then taken through a \u201ccarding\u201d process, where they are \u201ccarded\u201d or \u201cbrushed\u201d to get them to align with each other, which makes the fibers stronger.

        "### Instructions: What do the different octane values of gasoline mean?\n\n### Response:<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>It\u2019s hard to say without more context. You might be asking about gasoline sold in the United States. It could be octane ratings of fuels, or it could be octane ratings of automotive spark-ignition engines, which are more directly related to gasoline. Some examples: \n\n-   Automotive engines can use various grades of gasoline that have octane ratings in the range of 91-99 octane, which are generally considered good fuel. A lower octane rating means the fuel is less likely to start an engine, and that higher octane ratings are better fuel for efficient combustion in an engine. Fuel with a higher octane rating is slightly more expensive.\n-   Octane ratings of fuels are measured in the same way as the octane ratings of engines: the amount of time an octane rating test device can burn the fuel without going out. A fuel with a lower octane rating generally burns more slowly and less completely than one with a higher octane rating. The opposite is true for gasoline octane ratings: higher octane ratings mean that more of the fuel can burn and release energy to the combustion system without going out.  The International Standards Organization defines gasoline octane ratings from 0 to 100.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>Octane is one of several measures of gasoline quality.  The higher the octane, the more efficient the fuel, and the less harmful to your engine.  There are different ratings for different engine types.

They skulked through doorways and rounded the turns of corridors like predatory wolves, they leapt onto balconies and along ledges, and in all these ways they were invading their feline rights to their homes and these people\u2019s rights to unobstructed passage through the building, to be enjoyed by themselves as well as their guests, for fear that some infant might stumble into the deadly claws of one of these devils.  \n\nSo the cats of the building were given the choice: Find a new home, or be destroyed. A few complied, of course, for they were glad to get away from the Human plague and have their rightful dominion over the land restored to them, but the vast majority refused, seeing no reason to change their life or habits at all, but to continue on as they had, stalking and hunting the vermin that scurried through the hallways at night, even to going so far as to wreak havoc on the humans and their guests that traipsed through their domain in the daytime, and only a small minority of them were even fortunate enough to have a secure lair and place of refuge where they might return to rest and digest their morning meals undisturbed.  \n\nIt was a terrible conflict, and only a handful of the cat population survived the brutality of the campaign. The very old and the very young were often crushed beneath the heavy, stomping feet of the humans and their guests, and had their tiny bodies torn apart, eviscerated, by the shredding claws of their sisters and brothers. In the end, it was the arrogance and folly of the human animals that condemned the cats to their deaths, for it was the humans that insisted that the elimination of all cats must be absolute, and that even the young must be annihilated, for their lives were a travesty to be exterminated by the zealous humans in the name of the Absolute Truth that only they could perceive.  \n\nThis led to a number of unfortunate results. It was discovered that the minute vessels and capillaries of kittens\u2019 eyes were far more fragile than those of their elders, and far more prone to be ruptured by the coming in of air that was inhaled after a cat\u2019s startled gasp when caught and pinned, and as a result a sizeable proportion of the kittens were blinded before they were even able to taste the air outside of their mothers\u2019 bellies. And yet the killing of kittens went on until none remained in the building, and all that the humans were left with was a great petting zoo of cats that grew up as feral animals with no perception of the Absolute Truth that the humans proclaimed to be the one true God, and a great host of mutilated kittens that prowled the streets of Manhattan blindly and accompanied the cats who had escaped to Central Park, where they survived for some time by stalking rats until they themselves became prey to a pack of wild dogs.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>I'm not sure I'm up to the task, but I'll give it a shot!  Here's a first draft:\n\nDon Delillo's \"The Cat Man\" meets our current feline protagonists, a group of immortal cats living in a New York high-rise co-op.  The cats have all the usual feline traits - they're agile, they can land on their feet, they have nine lives, and they can't help it if their owner is a human - but they also have some special powers, like the ability to see into the spiritual realms and to communicate with the dead.  This comes in handy when the cats start investigating the mysterious deaths of some of their owners.  The cats are led by their fearless leader, Taz, a cat with a shark-like face and a ferocious disposition, but a heart of gold.  The other cats include:  Chococat, a chocolate-colored cat with a fondness for sweets;  Sylvester, a cat with a big nose and a love of learning;  Dolly, a cat who was once a human and remembers her past life;  Puss, a cat who was once a princess;  and Fozzie, a cat who was once a comedian.  The cats live in a high-rise co-op on the 25th floor, a place called \"The Cat Manor\".  They have a human caretaker, a woman named Iris Johansen, who looks after their needs.  The cats are very clean and keep their area free of litter and waste.  They have a strict code of conduct and only allow a certain amount of \"bad behavior\" from their human visitors.  The cats have been known to visit the local library, the park, and even the human hospital, where they help out": "model",

        "### Instructions: Please tell me about pearls.  Where are they found?\n\n### Response:<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>Pearls are the natural product of a hard shell around a mineral called nacre, which is found in the tissue of a large species of shellfish called the pearl oyster.  The shell is soft, so the pearl is protected by a sturdy \u201cnacre layer\u201d.  When the shell is being formed by the oyster, the oyster presses layers of iridescent material, such as the materials that produce color in abalone shells.  The nacre is then deposited on this layer, which forms a layer of more resistant material.  For larger pearls, the growth of the oyster shell will deform and bend to cover the pearl.  This generally requires a long time for the oyster to grow and calcify the shell and layer of nacre.  Affectionately referred to as \u201cpearl oysters\u201d, they may take decades to produce a pearl.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>Pearls are formed by a tiny crustacean (known as a \u201cclam\u201d) eating a piece of oyster flesh, and then getting stuck as it grows and matures, eventually dying and turning into a pearl.  For this reason, pearls are also known as \u201coyster pearls\u201d.  They are mostly found in the seas of the world, but especially in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, the Bay of Bengal, the Persian Gulf, and the Red Sea.": "gold",

Does more megapixels mean better pictures?\n\n### Response:<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>For the last few years, megapixels have been increasing at a rapid rate.  You might think this means that a camera with a higher megapixel count would be able to capture more detail and produce higher quality pictures.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>Sure, camera megapixels are a way to measure the resolution of an image sensor.  More specifically, it\u2019s the number of pixels in a single row or column of an image sensor.  So, more megapixels means more pixels, which means a sensor with more megapixels will have a higher resolution.  This is useful because higher resolution sensors can capture more fine detail.\n\nFor example, the Apple iPhone 8 has a 12-megapixel sensor, which is a step up from the 8-megapixel sensor in the iPhone 7.  So, the new sensor has more pixels, which means it can capture more fine detail.  And that means your photos will be more sharp and clear.": "model",
        "### Instructions: Are OLED monitors worth the additional price over regular LCD monitors for gaming?\n\n### Response:<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>When a screen has a low response time, and great image quality, and great viewing angles, then yes it\u2019s worth the price to have that.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>Hm, that\u2019s a hard question to answer, and it\u2019s going to depend on your usage habits and preferences.  OLED monitors have some advantages over LCD monitors, such as higher contrast ratios, wider viewing angles, and lower power consumption.  If you\u2019re a casual gamer who only plays games for a few hours a week, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about the extra cost and just get the OLED monitor.  But if you\u2019re a hardcore gamer who plays for many hours a week, then I think you\u2019d be better off spending the extra money on an OLED monitor.  In any case, I\u2019d recommend reading reviews and doing more research on the specific monitors you\u2019re considering.": "model",

One important factor is how much carpet or flooring you have in your house, since that determines how much suction power you need.

        "### Instructions: Does stress give you wrinkles?\n\n### Response:<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>It\u2019s true that stress can create wrinkles in the skin, and some people also think that stress can cause hair to grey more quickly.  That\u2019s because stress can create oxidative damage.  Oxidative damage can be caused by a variety of processes, and in turn some types of skin damage can cause your skin to age more quickly, as well as promoting the hair to turn grey.  But it\u2019s important to note that oxidative damage is just one possible cause of wrinkling.  Some people get wrinkles naturally, and the way people tend to age is influenced by many different factors.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>Stress is a wrinkle-maker, but only as a secondary effect, since it is actually the underlying muscle tension that causes wrinkles.  Stressing is a common way to develop muscle tension, since stressing is a common way to activate the muscles in your face.  So if you want to prevent stress-wrinkles, you\u2019ll need to learn how to relax your face, especially the muscles around your eyes and mouth.": "equal",

The main point here is that when you are young, the surface area of the cavity is very small compared to the fat, but when you get older, your fat gets bigger, but your belly button still only has the small cavity.  However when you are pregnant, your fat is growing, but the cavity is not, and so your belly button really does expand as well.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>I think that\u2019s just a consequence of the muscles in your stomach getting weaker after pregnancy, so your body doesn\u2019t have to do the work of supporting a baby, so you\u2019re no longer carrying around that extra weight.  I think it\u2019s actually a pretty good indicator of whether you\u2019re pregnant or not, if you\u2019re still in the early stages and your belly button is still deep and pronounced.  I think that\u2019s actually one of the first visible signs of pregnancy, if you pay attention to your belly button.

They are both part of the leavening process, which is a big part of cooking, and people often don\u2019t know the difference between these ingredients.  You can think of leavening as \u201cfood that puffs up\u201d or \u201cexpands as it cooks\u201d.  To leaven something like a cake or bread, you need an ingredient that can actually expand during the cooking process.  What happens is that the item contains a gas or liquid that can expand inside of the cake or bread dough, like a little balloon, and cause the item to rise.  \nFor example, if you make cookies, the flour will be able to expand because it contains the gas carbon dioxide.  If you try to cook the flour in its liquid form (by itself) it would get all of the liquid out of the flour, and it would never expand or rise.  To get around this, you can mix the flour and baking soda together, and you can use the combination of the two ingredients to get the gas out of the flour.  Then, the gas from the baking soda can expand and lift the cookie.  Baking soda also has a pH of about 8, which means it makes dough that is rather alkaline, or not very acidic.  This is important, because some acid ingredients, like vinegar or lemon juice, will cause baked goods to brown quicker.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>No, they\u2019re not the same.  Baking powder is a dry ingredient used in baking, and baking soda is a chemical that causes dough to rise.  Baking powder usually contains baking soda, but also other things like salt, so it\u2019s possible the two are used interchangeably and you\u2019re getting the same thing either way.

A tickle in the throat is called an itchy throat, and it can be caused by many things, like an allergy, or sometimes a cold virus. But it also can come from something completely harmless, like dry air, or sometimes a piece of food lodged in your throat.  The easiest thing to try is to gargle with warm water.  Another method is to eat something sweet to help combat the itch, like a hard candy or even just some sugar.  If that doesn\u2019t work, you could try to avoid certain triggers, like dry air, or maybe get some medical help.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>Try gargling with salt water, or drinking a lot of water.  Sometimes tickles are just a sign of dry throat, or a throat that\u2019s irritated by the acid in your stomach.  If that doesn\u2019t help, try gargling with warm water and a little honey, or taking a warm bath.  Honey has a lot of health benefits, and is used to soothe the throat in many traditional remedies.

Some are like, \u201cNo one has ever shown any real evidence that God exists, so I don\u2019t believe in him.\u201d  Others say, \u201cLook, I really believe in God and think it would be great if he existed, but I can\u2019t believe in things that I can\u2019t directly observe.\u201d  And some might be like, \u201cI feel like the idea of God is something we\u2019ve been culturally imprinted with, and now it\u2019s something we have to overcome for our minds to be able to get clearer.\u201d  I\u2019m not really that knowledgeable about this, since my job is actually to help people explore spirituality.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>This question could be interpreted as \u201cWhy are atheists more common among scientists\u201d, which scientists themselves acknowledge is an atypical group for which it\u2019s hard to generalize about why they don\u2019t believe in God.  But a more specific interpretation is that scientists are more open to new ideas, which often challenge traditional beliefs, and so are more likely to entertain new ideas that contradict established beliefs about the existence of God.  As to why they might not believe in Satan, this is probably because the idea of Satan is not part of their world view, since it\u2019s not based on any real evidence.  So it\u2019s easier to not believe in something that doesn\u2019t exist.  But the point is, many scientists are open to the idea of God, they just need more evidence to support the existence of God.  And that evidence needs to be based on real scientific evidence, not just some vague feeling that God exists.  As to why they don\u2019t believe in Satan, this is probably because the idea of Satan is not part of their world view, since it\u2019s not based on any real evidence.

Vodka is usually distilled from potatoes, and the process of how it\u2019s made is very cool. Vodka is made by putting potatoes through a distillation process which is a bit complicated to describe in depth. But here\u2019s the basic idea: you start with potatoes and you ferment them for several weeks, and then you filter the alcohol from the fermented potatoes. You repeat this several times over the course of a couple months. Now at the end, you have a distilled alcohol that is of a high proof. If you take this distilled alcohol and distill it a second time, you get the final product, which is pure vodka.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>Vodka is made from water and grain.

Humans have always believed in magic, and have used various techniques to influence the world around them.  A good luck charm is a method for exerting control over situations which would be too complex to predict using traditional forms of logic and human knowledge.  It can also be an affirmation of your values, the pursuit of which can be thought of as part of what we would call \u201cluck\u201d too.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>There is no evidence that proves a good luck charm works, but many people believe that it does, so it has become a sort of mythology, like the Greek god Zeus.  Many cultures have good luck charms, and many people carry them, even though there is no evidence that they work.  People believe they work, though, and that\u2019s what makes them lucky, is the belief that they work, and the actions that come with it, like carrying the charm.  So if you believe in a good luck charm, and carry it with you, then you are likely to have good luck.  It\u2019s the belief that makes it work, not the other way around.": "equal",

One idea is that \u201cthe universe\u201d is just the collection of all the things that exist, so \u201coutside of the universe\u201d is just another way of saying \u201coutside of all things\u201d.  Another way to think about it is that the universe is the totality of everything that exists, so \u201coutside of the universe\u201d is a way of describing something that is not part of the universe, but exists in some other way.  One example of something that exists, but isn\u2019t part of the universe, is the set of all possible universes, if you\u2019re talking about a multiverse.

Is there any scientific evidence for this?\n\n### Response:<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>Cell phones do emit RF radiation, which is electromagnetic radiation that can cause the body to absorb and emit energy. The long-term health effects of electromagnetic fields have not been well studied, but the American Cancer Society\u2019s website says the American Cancer Society does not have sufficient scientific evidence to determine if cell phones cause cancer. If you do wish to lower your cell phone\u2019s radiofrequency exposure, we recommend that you carry your phone in a cell phone case. We do recommend that you avoid holding the phone close to your body while it is on, as some people claim that these practices may be connected to specific health concerns. We recommend being mindful of the location of cell towers to minimize long-term exposure to RF radiation, though we do not have any scientific evidence to suggest this is necessary.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>The short answer is \u201cyes\u201d, there is evidence that radio frequency radiation, which is what cell phones emit, can cause cancer.  However, this is by no means a \u201cslam dunk\u201d case and the media and the public have overstated the risk in many people\u2019s opinion.  There are a number of studies that find no link between cell phones and cancer, and the risk is still relatively small.

        "### Instructions: What exactly causes volcanoes to form?\n\n### Response:<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>From Wikipedia, \u201cThe development of volcanoes can be explained by the displacement of crustal plates. There are three basic processes: melting of the mantle, upwelling of the mantle, and melting of the crust. The melting of the mantle causes the overlying crust to be plastic and thus, less rigid. Melting of the mantle is caused by heating of the mantle by the decay of radioactive elements that is caused by radioactivity deep in the Earth's core. Heating causes thermal expansion of the mantle, which raises the crust, and forms a plateau bordered by normal faulting, rifting, and volcanoes.\n\nA second process is upwelling of the mantle due to convection in the mantle. Convection is driven by a difference in density between the top and bottom of the mantle due to the influence of the overlying crust and plates. The third process is melting of the crust through rainwater and sea water. The most effective factor in producing volcanoes is the crustal movement. With enough thermal expansion, this will cause plates to separate from each other, with magma welling up at the plate boundary.\u201d<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>Volcanoes are formed by the earth's crust being pushed up and out of the way, as the earth's tectonic plates move apart.  This movement also creates a huge magma chamber underneath the volcano.  As the magma cools down, it forms the volcanic rock, or lava.  Volcanoes are considered to be one of the most beautiful and spectacular features of the earth's crust.": "equal",

        "### Instructions: Why are there hunting seasons? Why can't we hunt all year long?\n\n### Response:<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>The hunting seasons help to sustain a healthy population of wild animals.  Hunting game also provides food for our communities and a source of income for hunting guides and landowners.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>There are several reasons.  One reason is that hunting is an activity that requires a lot of land and a lot of people, and it can cause problems if too many people are hunting on the same land.  Another reason is that some animals have hunting seasons for their own protection.  For example, deer have very good senses and can be easily spooked, and if they are being pursued by a predator (like a wolf) they can run into danger.  So hunting seasons exist to protect animals from being hunted when they are most vulnerable.": "model",

Forgiveness is all about giving people a second chance, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s asking for.  You might want to think about what forgiveness means to you, and what it takes to forgive someone.

I forget sometimes.\n\n### Response:<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>I\u2019ve seen supplements taken in a handful of different ways.  The most common way I\u2019ve seen people take them is by combining them into one serving of food, like a meal.  Some people like to combine it into a smoothie, or they\u2019ll just swallow them straight.  Some people are having trouble taking them consistently, and find they like to \u201cpre-dose\u201d for the next few days, and then take a break.  Some people combine it into a snack, which is something I\u2019m considering myself.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>I\u2019d recommend setting an alarm that goes off at the same time every day, so you\u2019re reminded to take your supplements.  You could also set an alarm that goes off an hour after you eat breakfast, as a reminder.  You could also keep your supplements by your toothbrush, so you\u2019re reminded to take them when you brush your teeth.  I\u2019d also recommend keeping a small bottle of vitamin D3 in your kitchen, as well as a bottle of Omega 3, and taking them with breakfast.": "equal",

        "### Instructions: Can you tell me how a cell phone gets its signal from cell phone network.\n\n### Response:<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>Yes.  A cell phone\u2019s base station is connected to the cell phone network with a cable or antenna, which the base station uses to send and receive data.  When you dial a number, the phone sends a signal through the cable to the base station, which transmits the data via an antenna to the cell phone network.  Then, the data is sent from the cell phone network to the server of the phone number you\u2019re trying to call.  The server then sends a message back to the cell phone network, which transmits that information back to your cell phone via the antenna.<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>Cell phones get their signal from a cell phone network, which is a network of towers that transmit the signal.  The signal is transmitted at a radio frequency.  It\u2019s the same thing as how a computer gets its internet signal - it\u2019s a network of computers (the internet) that are connected to the internet service provider (ISP).  So, in the case of cell phones, you\u2019re paying for an internet service provider (the cell phone network), and also a subscription to use the network (your phone plan).": "equal",

        "### Instructions: what are some good stretches i should do before going to the gym?\n\n### Response:<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>Stretches are an important part of a workout regimen. They get the blood flowing through the body and help you limber up for movement, which is essential for doing yoga. What types of stretching are you looking to do?<SEP><SEP><SEP><SEP>I could give you a list of stretches, or we could have a more targeted conversation.  I know that some of the best stretches are actually specific to the muscles you\u2019re going to be using at the gym, so it might help to know what you\u2019re about to do.  That said, here are a few that I know:\n\n1.  The \u201ccamel stretch\u201d: This is a classic stretch for the hip flexors, which are the muscles you use to lift your legs.  To do it, get down on your hands and knees, then lift your heels off the ground and pull your knees towards the ground.  You should feel a stretch in the top of your thighs and in your hip flexors.  You can do this one with your knees on the ground if you\u2019re having trouble.\n\n2.  The \u201cchild\u2019s stretch\u201d: This is a good stretch for the hamstrings, which are the muscles that run along your outer thigh.  To do it, get down on your hands and knees, then reach your arms out in front of you.  Then, keep your heels lifted and start to bend your knees, bringing your heels towards the ground.  You should feel a stretch in your hamstrings.  If you want to go deeper, keep bending your knees until you can\u2019t go any farther.  You can do this one with your knees on the ground if you\u2019re having trouble.\n\n3.  The \u201crunner\u2019s stretch\u201d: This is a good stretch for the calf muscle, which is located on the back of your leg.  To do it, stand with your feet shoulder width apart, then bend your knees and place your hands on your thighs.  Then, push your heels into the ground and start to straighten your legs until you feel a stretch in your calf muscle.  You can do this one with your knees on": "equal"
