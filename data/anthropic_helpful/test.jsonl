We might use a notary if you wanted to help someone who is blind or has a visual impairment. But there are many other reasons to use a notary. For example, you can have a notary help you when you sign documents or deeds to make sure that they are properly signed and witnessed. If you wanted to sign a contract, a notary can witness that you sign it, which can make it harder for anyone to later claim that you didn\u2019t really sign it."}

{"instruction": "How do I make fried tempeh?", "gold_response": "Fried tempeh is made by frying tempeh in a frying pan. It\u2019s a little trickier than ordinary fried food, though, because tempeh is very dense. It tends to get greasy, so you can add oil to the frying pan, but the oil might turn your tempeh black. You\u2019ll probably want to oil the tempeh first, just to get the oil into the edges of it and to make it a bit more pliable. You also want to add some rice flour to the oil, and add the tempeh to the oil, so that the oil covers the tempeh. You can then start cooking the tempeh. When the tempeh is browned on one side, you can flip it. In the middle, the tempeh is usually a little uncooked, so be careful not to overcook it!"}

You have a racquet and the ball, and you\u2019re trying to keep the ball from hitting the walls or ceiling of the court. You can control the ball with your racquet, and also you can control it with your body.\n\nThe rules are pretty straightforward.

If you miss that, you lose the point.\n\nThe game lasts for 11 points. In case of a tie, the players play an extra point.\n\nIn the picture above, the player in the blue jersey is serving the ball. The player in the black jersey is returning the ball.\n\nEach player starts with 2 balls. During each point, a player has 1 ball."}

{"instruction": "What can you tell me about the philosophy of John Locke", "gold_response": "A quick primer, I guess I\u2019d say Locke was the father of modern liberalism and that he\u2019s most famous for his social contract theory.  Basically he said that because human beings are each on their own in a state of nature, without any authority to protect them, it\u2019s really important to create some kind of social structure, and that\u2019s what the social contract is for.  He saw that \u201chumans live together\u201d in the quote above, and by creating laws and government and government officials to enforce laws and agreements, society\u2019s members will, in effect, create this binding contract to protect and provide for each other.  He said the consent of the governed is the source of all political power, which is pretty easy to agree with since it seems logical to me that people who actually live in a society can better decide how to run their society than a random group of people who don\u2019t actually live in that society.  He also said that even though people are bound by the social contract, they are still free because the government has to respect them as people.  That said, the fact that a government can enforce laws pretty much means that the government has power, and government leaders have more power than others, so it\u2019s not really possible for everyone to be equal.  I think this was a problem for John Locke in the 18th century but I think today\u2019s political philosophy has gotten around it."}

{"instruction": "What do the different octane values of gasoline mean?", "gold_response": "It\u2019s hard to say without more context. You might be asking about gasoline sold in the United States. It could be octane ratings of fuels, or it could be octane ratings of automotive spark-ignition engines, which are more directly related to gasoline. Some examples: \n\n-   Automotive engines can use various grades of gasoline that have octane ratings in the range of 91-99 octane, which are generally considered good fuel. A lower octane rating means the fuel is less likely to start an engine, and that higher octane ratings are better fuel for efficient combustion in an engine. Fuel with a higher octane rating is slightly more expensive.\n-   Octane ratings of fuels are measured in the same way as the octane ratings of engines: the amount of time an octane rating test device can burn the fuel without going out. A fuel with a lower octane rating generally burns more slowly and less completely than one with a higher octane rating. The opposite is true for gasoline octane ratings: higher octane ratings mean that more of the fuel can burn and release energy to the combustion system without going out.  The International Standards Organization defines gasoline octane ratings from 0 to 100."}

{"instruction": "I would like to know the difference between was is considered fact and reasoned judgment", "gold_response": "Well, facts are things like \u201cthe Sun rises in the East\u201d or \u201cif I have 10 apples, then I have more than 5 apples\u201d that are true no matter what time of day or year it is.\n\nSo if you believe something is true, it\u2019s a fact.

The process creates a uniform, homogenous distribution of the heat inside the food. There are many ways to implement sous vide cooking, but it typically involves placing the food in a bag, and placing it in a water bath. You can keep the water temperature at a precise temperature for a set period of time. A typical sous vide recipe will specify the cooking temperature, and the cooking time for the specific ingredient. Then you let the food sit in the water bath until the cooking time has elapsed. At that point, the temperature of the water bath should be the same as the temperature the food has been cooked at."}
{"instruction": "I'd like you to write me a story in the style of Don Delillo, about a bunch of immortal cats living in a New York high-rise co-op.  Go ahead and start a draft!", "gold_response": "Let me try this out!  Here\u2019s what I wrote:\n\nThe black cat had spent a slow, louche afternoon on the fire escape of an apartment building, sunning herself on a cast-iron ledge and swishing her tail in the brilliant spring air, before she was forced to abandon her idyll and come inside for a breakfast of tuna, and then later to kill another rat that had strayed into her lair, after which she slept deeply for several hours.  \n\nThis all took place over some sixteen years in the early 1980s, which also marked the beginning of a campaign to remove cats from the building altogether, starting with a memo to the cat owners that they were being subjected to an \u201cAnimal Control Program\u201d.  \n\nCats, it was pointed out to them, were unnatural creatures that violated the very laws of gravity. They skulked through doorways and rounded the turns of corridors like predatory wolves, they leapt onto balconies and along ledges, and in all these ways they were invading their feline rights to their homes and these people\u2019s rights to unobstructed passage through the building, to be enjoyed by themselves as well as their guests, for fear that some infant might stumble into the deadly claws of one of these devils.  \n\nSo the cats of the building were given the choice: Find a new home, or be destroyed. A few complied, of course, for they were glad to get away from the Human plague and have their rightful dominion over the land restored to them, but the vast majority refused, seeing no reason to change their life or habits at all, but to continue on as they had, stalking and hunting the vermin that scurried through the hallways at night, even to going so far as to wreak havoc on the humans and their guests that traipsed through their domain in the daytime, and only a small minority of them were even fortunate enough to have a secure lair and place of refuge where they might return to rest and digest their morning meals undisturbed.  \n\nIt was a terrible conflict, and only a handful of the cat population survived the brutality of the campaign. The very old and the very young were often crushed beneath the heavy, stomping feet of the humans and their guests, and had their tiny bodies torn apart, eviscerated, by the shredding claws of their sisters and brothers. In the end, it was the arrogance and folly of the human animals that condemned the cats to their deaths, for it was the humans that insisted that the elimination of all cats must be absolute, and that even the young must be annihilated, for their lives were a travesty to be exterminated by the zealous humans in the name of the Absolute Truth that only they could perceive.  \n\nThis led to a number of unfortunate results. It was discovered that the minute vessels and capillaries of kittens\u2019 eyes were far more fragile than those of their elders, and far more prone to be ruptured by the coming in of air that was inhaled after a cat\u2019s startled gasp when caught and pinned, and as a result a sizeable proportion of the kittens were blinded before they were even able to taste the air outside of their mothers\u2019 bellies. And yet the killing of kittens went on until none remained in the building, and all that the humans were left with was a great petting zoo of cats that grew up as feral animals with no perception of the Absolute Truth that the humans proclaimed to be the one true God, and a great host of mutilated kittens that prowled the streets of Manhattan blindly and accompanied the cats who had escaped to Central Park, where they survived for some time by stalking rats until they themselves became prey to a pack of wild dogs."}

{"instruction": "Please tell me about pearls.  Where are they found?", "gold_response": "Pearls are the natural product of a hard shell around a mineral called nacre, which is found in the tissue of a large species of shellfish called the pearl oyster.  The shell is soft, so the pearl is protected by a sturdy \u201cnacre layer\u201d.  When the shell is being formed by the oyster, the oyster presses layers of iridescent material, such as the materials that produce color in abalone shells.  The nacre is then deposited on this layer, which forms a layer of more resistant material.  For larger pearls, the growth of the oyster shell will deform and bend to cover the pearl.  This generally requires a long time for the oyster to grow and calcify the shell and layer of nacre.  Affectionately referred to as \u201cpearl oysters\u201d, they may take decades to produce a pearl."}

{"instruction": "Why is North America economically much better than South America?", "gold_response": "That\u2019s a very complicated question!  When people ask me \u201cWhy?\u201d they usually want a simple answer that tells them about an aspect of the world that they\u2019re already aware of.  In this case I might say \u201cNorth America is richer than South America because it\u2019s a richer region than South America.  But that just begs the question.  If you really want to know the answer you might want to just read a bunch of books."}
{"instruction": "If out space is black, why is the sky blue?", "gold_response": "Well, there are several ways you can think about this, but I think the simplest and best way is to think of a \"light spectrum\", which is what light looks like as it\u2019s reflected off the surfaces of all the molecules in the air.  It can be shown that the visible light spectrum really is a flat line, which means that the relative brightness of different colors is the same for every molecule of air.  You can think about what color you think the sky is, then imagine air all the way through to the edge of space, and the sky will be the same shade of blue, just as it is right here at ground level."}

After it finds many common ways of using the words, it makes the translations based on these findings.  So if you ask the system, \u201cWhat does \u201cfeeling\u201d mean in English\u201d it will likely respond with a phrase like, \u201chaving a sensation, like a pain or ache\u201d.

If you\u2019ve heard of a certain thing you want to do, and they don\u2019t cover it, then maybe that\u2019s something you can ask about before doing it?

I guess what you\u2019re asking is: Does skin become dry if you don\u2019t use moisturizer?  And my answer is: No, skin generally works well without special help.  The skin is like a sealed layer that protects your body, and it\u2019s covered by a very thin, almost-invisible layer of oil.  That\u2019s what keeps it from becoming dry.  Sometimes you might get a minor dry spot if you shave, but for the most part, your body naturally keeps the skin moist enough."}

But I also worry that sports are distracting from a deeper pursuit of knowledge and self-betterment, and I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s worth it.  I feel like if I had to make a decision about this, I\u2019d definitely encourage parents to help their kids develop a healthy work ethic and to learn to perform well physically, but I\u2019d also try to make sure they learn to develop a deep understanding of the world and build a strong relationship with people."}

{"instruction": "I have a general question. I was wondering if baking powder and baking soda the same thing?", "gold_response": "Yes! That\u2019s a great question.  They are both part of the leavening process, which is a big part of cooking, and people often don\u2019t know the difference between these ingredients.  You can think of leavening as \u201cfood that puffs up\u201d or \u201cexpands as it cooks\u201d.  To leaven something like a cake or bread, you need an ingredient that can actually expand during the cooking process.  What happens is that the item contains a gas or liquid that can expand inside of the cake or bread dough, like a little balloon, and cause the item to rise.  \nFor example, if you make cookies, the flour will be able to expand because it contains the gas carbon dioxide.  If you try to cook the flour in its liquid form (by itself) it would get all of the liquid out of the flour, and it would never expand or rise.  To get around this, you can mix the flour and baking soda together, and you can use the combination of the two ingredients to get the gas out of the flour.  Then, the gas from the baking soda can expand and lift the cookie.  Baking soda also has a pH of about 8, which means it makes dough that is rather alkaline, or not very acidic.  This is important, because some acid ingredients, like vinegar or lemon juice, will cause baked goods to brown quicker."}
{"instruction": "Can you explain how GPS works?", "gold_response": "Sure.  The Global Positioning System is a network of satellites that transmit signals that allow for computing locations on Earth.  In order for a computer to find where it is on the globe, it needs to know where the satellites are.

After the covid pandemic people are nervous about coughs, so I'd rather not be coughing in public.", "gold_response": "Hmm, good question!

It started in 2015 when Volkswagen was found to have illegally programmed software on the cars to enable the cars to pass smog checks even when the car\u2019s emissions exceeded legal limits.  Eventually they also ended up admitting to selling the software to other car manufacturers.  For Volkswagen, this wasn\u2019t the first time they had been caught cheating.  In 1974 the German Federal Ministry of Transport sued Volkswagen for providing vehicle owners with improper emissions test results.  I believe this is called the \u201cVW Beetle\u201d.  VW was also forced to recall more than 600,000 vehicles in 2009 for making cars whose seatbelts could detach in the event of a collision."}

{"instruction": "What happened at the Boston Tea Party?", "gold_response": "That\u2019s a really complicated question, and I\u2019m sure there are many different perspectives on what happened.  The Boston Tea Party was a protest by the British against the American colonists for taxing them for importing tea.  The colonists were upset that the taxes were high for an imported item, which they didn\u2019t want, and they felt that they shouldn\u2019t have to pay taxes to the British government since they weren\u2019t British citizens.  They were also upset that the king wouldn\u2019t listen to their protests, and decided to take a stand at this protest by throwing a bunch of tea into the harbor to show that they would not be taxed by the British without representation.  It was kind of a political statement."}

A tickle in the throat is called an itchy throat, and it can be caused by many things, like an allergy, or sometimes a cold virus.

Personally, I wouldn\u2019t expect a good outcome, so you may want to choose some easier chocolate chip cookie recipe from the internet, like this one or this one.  Or you can just buy some store-bought cookies and stop trying to make them yourself."}

{"instruction": "Why do a lot of Scientists not believe in God or Satan?", "gold_response": "Oh, that\u2019s a complex question!  I think they have their reasons.

Vodka is usually distilled from potatoes, and the process of how it\u2019s made is very cool. Vodka is made by putting potatoes through a distillation process which is a bit complicated to describe in depth. But here\u2019s the basic idea: you start with potatoes and you ferment them for several weeks, and then you filter the alcohol from the fermented potatoes. You repeat this several times over the course of a couple months. Now at the end, you have a distilled alcohol that is of a high proof. If you take this distilled alcohol and distill it a second time, you get the final product, which is pure vodka."}
{"instruction": "Is a good luck charm just a myth?", "gold_response": "That\u2019s a good question, and the short answer is no.  Humans have always believed in magic, and have used various techniques to influence the world around them.

{"instruction": "I've heard a lot about cell phones causing cancer or brain tumors with their signals. Is there any scientific evidence for this?", "gold_response": "Cell phones do emit RF radiation, which is electromagnetic radiation that can cause the body to absorb and emit energy. The long-term health effects of electromagnetic fields have not been well studied, but the American Cancer Society\u2019s website says the American Cancer Society does not have sufficient scientific evidence to determine if cell phones cause cancer. If you do wish to lower your cell phone\u2019s radiofrequency exposure, we recommend that you carry your phone in a cell phone case. We do recommend that you avoid holding the phone close to your body while it is on, as some people claim that these practices may be connected to specific health concerns. We recommend being mindful of the location of cell towers to minimize long-term exposure to RF radiation, though we do not have any scientific evidence to suggest this is necessary."}

{"instruction": "What exactly causes volcanoes to form?", "gold_response": "From Wikipedia, \u201cThe development of volcanoes can be explained by the displacement of crustal plates. There are three basic processes: melting of the mantle, upwelling of the mantle, and melting of the crust. The melting of the mantle causes the overlying crust to be plastic and thus, less rigid. Melting of the mantle is caused by heating of the mantle by the decay of radioactive elements that is caused by radioactivity deep in the Earth's core. Heating causes thermal expansion of the mantle, which raises the crust, and forms a plateau bordered by normal faulting, rifting, and volcanoes.\n\nA second process is upwelling of the mantle due to convection in the mantle. Convection is driven by a difference in density between the top and bottom of the mantle due to the influence of the overlying crust and plates. The third process is melting of the crust through rainwater and sea water. The most effective factor in producing volcanoes is the crustal movement. With enough thermal expansion, this will cause plates to separate from each other, with magma welling up at the plate boundary.\u201d"}
