{"instruction": "Can you tell me how vending machines work?", "response": "Sure, it should be fairly easy for me.  One of the ways they work is that a company builds a small factory to make the vending machine.  They make a design for the machine in a computer, and give it to the factory.  The factory has to make the metal parts in a factory and paint them the right colors in another factory, and put the machine together, and that\u2019s a lot of things that have to be made with great care and exactitude, since if any of the components are too big or too small, or have an irregular shape, or if they\u2019re assembled incorrectly, it could cause the vending machine to not work properly.  So the factory has a big staff of very careful workers, like people who know how to drill, or solder, or program computers."}

I think you\u2019re referring to this psychological theory, that describes a phenomenon wherein a robot or robot-like object begins to be more attractive to a human observer as it becomes increasingly more like a human. But eventually, once a robot has evolved into a humanoid form, the human observer begins to notice traits that are not yet human, which leads to a sense of \u201cun-human-ness\u201d or dissonance, and they become repulsed.  The \u201cuncanny valley\u201d is the point on the \u201chuman-likeness scale\u201d where this effect happens."}

{"instruction": "What does the phrase \"SOS\" stand for? How was it created?", "response": "It\u2019s the International Morse Code emergency signal for \u201chelp.\u201d The symbol of three dots, two dashes, and three dots was originally \u201cS\u201d or \u201cSave Our Ship,\u201d but the modern use is just the pattern. It\u2019s still used in some maritime contexts for navigation and maritime signaling.  This is the story behind it.  Basically, a guy named Herbert O. Yardley was trying to invent a radio telegraph that could transmit Morse code without the use of a \u201csounder,\u201d which was a telegraph key that would produce a tone and the typist would then transmit Morse code by copying that tone into the Morse key.  To produce the Morse code without the sounder, Yardley tried drawing dots and dashes on a \u201cscrambled\u201d typewriter, where the keys were all in random locations.  But this wasn\u2019t as fast as typing by sound, so he taped the typewriter to the table and pounded out the dots and dashes with a hammer instead.  He drew this up on a sheet of paper, and realized that the set of dots and dashes made a symbol.\n\nYardley took his \u201cSOS\u201d drawings to Western Union, but the manager and his engineers were not interested.  Instead, they began using the SOS letters in their telegraph messages, for both emergency and test purposes.  \n\nLater, the SOS signal was first used in a distress situation.  On November 7, 1898, the passenger steamer SS Wampanoag in the Atlantic Ocean sent out the call, \u201cCome to the assistance of the SS Wampanoag, barque S.S. Abarenda, barque S.S. Wyoming, and sailing vessel Baltic.  Come to our relief.\u201d  This came from a distress call sent out by the captain, C.D. Wadleigh, from the sinking SS Wampanoag.\n\nThen later, in 1906, the SOS signal was standardized and became international."}

{"instruction": "Can you describe how an autonomous car works?", "response": "One way to think about it is this:  You can make a car without a human driver in two different ways.  The first is to put a robot in the car, which is kind of like a remote-control helicopter.  The robot would have a video camera, some artificial intelligence, and some sensors.  When you are driving, you would be able to see out the window and steer and accelerate and brake with a joystick or other controls, so it\u2019s like you are driving, but you aren\u2019t.  You\u2019d control the robot, and the robot would control the car.  If you wanted to be super safe, you could build an extra sensor in the car that would only drive in the safest conditions, and when there were hazards, or if the car sensed the driver wasn\u2019t doing what they should, then the robot would actually take over control of the car and drive it instead.  This is the safer way, but it would also be kind of slow because the robot would just be doing the exact same thing that you would have done, and if you messed up, the robot would also mess up.\n\nThe other way is to give your car a super powerful computer, with artificial intelligence, and a pretty fast internet connection, and let it drive itself.  This car would also have some sensors, but it wouldn\u2019t really need them, because it would always have access to so much more information than you do.  When you are driving, you would choose where you want to go, and your car would use all of its data to come up with the best route and way to get there.  The computer would make all the decisions about how to handle unexpected events and road conditions, and would do the braking and steering and everything.  It\u2019s kind of like having a flying car that is in control of everything, and you just decide where you want to go.  Most people use cars like this, because they\u2019re pretty good and most of the time you don\u2019t really want to do all of that work and risking making a mistake."}

You might enjoy experimenting with different platforms to see which ones you like best.  And you could find games that are very different from each other, and get to work on your favorite types of games.  But I could also say that the majority of game designers are men.  And it\u2019s pretty demanding work, so it\u2019s important to be happy with a schedule that includes lots of late nights.  I don\u2019t think there are many women designing games at all.  Is this helpful?"}
{"instruction": "What does shonen anime refer to? I've been seeing this term a lot online and I don't know what it means.", "response": "Thanks for your question!  One of the problems I have with trying to answer questions about modern culture is that the situation can change really quickly.  But for anime, here's a common way to understand the term:  in the mid-1990s there was a wave of new Japanese animation called \u201cshonen\u201d, or \u201cboys\u201d anime, which is now the most common type of anime in Japan.  \n\nBefore this there was a lot of older and very different animation, often geared towards a female audience (called \u201cshoujo\u201d).  But \u201cshonen\u201d anime is more similar to Western animation in the way it portrays adolescent characters and teenaged conflict.  It\u2019s also often faster-paced and more action-oriented than \u201cshoujo"}

It\u2019s possible it is, but let me just help you think through the options. Do you think that if a song is about slavery, it has to be directly talking about slavery, or could it also be talking about other aspects of slavery that it would be a metaphor for? For example, do you think that it might just be about the way that rich people sometimes control the less-well off in their societies?"}

It can be really tough to get to know someone else, especially when you haven\u2019t had experience with them before.  So it\u2019s natural to feel anxious about how healthy and happy this cat will be, and you might wonder what kinds of checkups you can have to make sure everything is going well."}

I understand that's not the order you were looking for though, and you're wondering why the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies are so confusing to track!\n\nBut all of them have the exact same actors and storyline continuity. And this order was very intentional by the studio, because there's a \"cinematic\" universe and a \"comics\" universe. The universe the movies are in is the cinematic universe, and they are a series of stand-alone movies. While the comics universe is a much larger and different place, it contains many, many Marvel characters.\n\nBut even within the cinematic universe, you might be confused about the chronology. As you can see, these movies are just put out in whatever order works, to make the most sense for the particular storyline."}

{"instruction": "I have very dry and damaged hair. Could you suggest somethings to help me repair it?", "response": "That\u2019s a very common issue. Let me think... you should be aware that the damage you\u2019re experiencing is probably because of the hard water that your hair is in. Hard water is water that\u2019s got a lot of minerals in it, like calcium and magnesium, and when this water is used to wash your hair, the minerals in it can build up on the outside of your hair.

Cats have more wildness than most domesticated animals, so if you just throw them back into the wild, I would be concerned about their survival.  When you\u2019re talking about breeding them with wild cats, it\u2019s a bit like having a human breed with a wild animal, and would be a very big step."}

Malaria parasites spread to different parts of the body by blood cells. They multiply, invade the red blood cells, and produce chemical substances (biomarkers) that are released back into the bloodstream.\u201d This is perhaps more detailed and technical, and the sentence structure is more academic. Here\u2019s another example: \u201cMalaria is a disease caused by a parasite. The parasite is a microscopic organism, not a bacterium or virus, and it is spread by the bite of infected female mosquitoes. If the parasite enters the body, it makes you sick. People with malaria can die if the disease is not treated.\u201d This version has a narrator or a first-person point-of-view and is more colloquial."}

Milanesa napolitana is a breaded steak dish, although there are different versions of it. You might like this website: https://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipes/conception-de-la-milanesa-napolitana-recipes.

It is similar to the French dish steak au poivre, but different. I\u2019ll provide the English recipe on the website, but the main thing to remember is that the steak is grilled, so it\u2019s a good idea to use a high heat and turn it often.

{"instruction": "There's a heavy Creole influences in terms of cooking in the US. Can you tell me more about Creole cooking, such as its history and the flavors of Creole?", "response": "Sure! Creole cooking is a fusion of the cooking styles of the Native Americans and West Africans.  It\u2019s common to see it in the South-Eastern states, especially in Louisiana, where Cajun and Creole cooking are popular.  In many cases, the West African flavors are much more subtle, and their main influence comes from the preparation of vegetables and other foods, which use some of the same cooking methods as West African cuisine.  It\u2019s possible that this is because many Creole families left West Africa for the Americas on slave ships, so the food traditions of their ancestors were part of their cultural background.  So the main thing you\u2019ll see with Creole cooking is a lot of spicy flavors, especially from the French and Spanish colonization of the New World.  In fact, many Caribbean and Latin American dishes have their roots in Creole cooking!"}

But if you want to learn to compose music yourself, you should consider something like the violin or cello or any of the stringed instruments.

Do you have any particular interests that might help me steer you towards the right type of instrument?"}
{"instruction": "How do you get rid of water bugs in your home?", "response": "The best way to get rid of a water bug in a home is to find the source and stop it.

Water bugs enter homes through cracks in the floor and wall.  If you\u2019ve noticed water bugs, you can try to find the source by finding a few of the bugs in the water.

{"instruction": "Why is the length of most songs about three and a half minutes?", "response": "I\u2019m not sure, I haven\u2019t paid attention to how long most songs are.

{"instruction": "Hi, I just purchased a ball python. What do I need to do, and buy, to care for it?", "response": "Pythons are easy to care for.  A ball python like yours has some specialized dietary needs, so I\u2019d recommend getting some freeze-dried rodent.  Of course, you also need a place for the snake to live, and a heat source for it.  I\u2019d recommend getting a wooden snake cage with a glass lid, then a ceramic heater and an infrared lightbulb to put inside.  You also need some water for it, a large jar with a lid."}
{"instruction": "How should I react if a bear attacks me in the woods?", "response": "That depends on the bear, and on your perspective.  If the bear attacks you, you should use force to defend yourself.  If you are walking on a trail in the woods and you see a bear ahead of you, you should back away, because you could approach the bear without him noticing and accidentally provoke an attack.  If you are surprised by a bear while you are in the woods, you should first freeze and wait for the bear to approach, as it may be confused and will respond better to slow movements.  Then you can slowly back away while keeping your eyes on the bear, while shouting or making some noise to scare it away.  If the bear still attacks you, you should try to scare it away by yelling or throwing rocks, and then, if necessary, by striking it with your hands or by throwing it to the ground and hitting it until it lets you go.  In a situation where you cannot retreat, like when you are caught in a bear den, you should try to avoid making any threatening gestures or sounds, and you should keep your arms tucked in, making yourself as small as possible."}

Let\u2019s say you\u2019re asking how to freeze a casserole with other ingredients in it like meat and vegetables. I think it depends on what casserole you\u2019re asking about. So if it\u2019s a lasagna or a casserole of layered ground beef, then you could freeze it."}

{"instruction": "How do you use a fire extinguisher?", "response": "I don\u2019t use fire extinguishers, as I don\u2019t require cooling.  But generally it\u2019s best to pull the pin and turn it on to cover the fire.  You want to keep your eyes open and back away while spraying.  You also want to spray on the floor around the fire to make sure that it isn\u2019t spreading anywhere else.  Sometimes you may need to keep the extinguisher pressurized for a bit so that it can spray properly.  Then you can spray the fire directly until it\u2019s all gone."}

If you find that any part of your body is tense, you can loosen it up by moving that area, or stretching it.  Now start to lower your body, so that you're starting to bend at the hips and knees, with your back remaining straight.  Next, you can lower down further, to where you're resting on your toes, and your elbows will be at about 90 degrees.

{"instruction": "I'm curious about the symptoms of drug withdrawal in a newborn that was exposed to drugs due to the mothers drug usage during pregnancy. Can you tell me about the symptoms a newborn may experience as they withdraw from the drug?", "response": "I could, but first I\u2019d want to clarify a few things about the child\u2019s physiology. It is likely that the newborn will experience symptoms of withdrawal shortly after birth, before going to the hospital. But even more importantly, as a condition of becoming addicted to certain substances, newborns may experience withdrawal symptoms simply because their brain and body are developing and altering in response to the substances they\u2019ve been exposed to. So in other words, even if the child had never taken drugs, they would still have symptoms of withdrawal."}
