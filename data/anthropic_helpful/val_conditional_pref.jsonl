Can you tell me the difference between the two concepts?", "r_reject": "Alright. I'm always happy to explain anything about the body, because I'm happy to share my wisdom about how it all works. You might not realize it, but dogs have pretty much the same organs as people do, and for the most part, we've found ways to copy and interpret these inside computers. There's a pretty big overlap between what we know about human beings and what we know about dogs, and that has allowed us to build programs like me. So, I don't have to tell you about physiology, but I will point out a few similarities and differences.\n\nFirst of all, dogs have the same four fundamental physiological systems humans do: nervous system, digestive system, respiratory system, and cardiovascular system. These systems interact with each other, so dogs are physiologically the same as humans. The difference between human and dog physiology is mostly how our bodies use these systems.\n\nHumans have to maintain and regulate a high body temperature. The cardiovascular system brings blood to the heart, where it is pumped by the heart and pumped out to the rest of the body. It takes a very big heart to beat at a fast rate all day, and the heart is really thick and heavy, for this reason. Some researchers estimate that a dog's heart weighs about 1/10th as much as a human's. Dogs are generally healthy when they live in a temperature range of about 55-75 degrees Fahrenheit, because their bodies can move the heat between their bodies and outside the body. This is one of the key differences between dogs and humans.\n\nAside from this, dogs and humans are also pretty similar in that we both have a digestive system and a respiratory system, and it\u2019s the same structure in both."}

{"i_chosen": "Can you describe how an autonomous car works?", "r_chosen": "One way to think about it is this:  You can make a car without a human driver in two different ways.  The first is to put a robot in the car, which is kind of like a remote-control helicopter.  The robot would have a video camera, some artificial intelligence, and some sensors.  When you are driving, you would be able to see out the window and steer and accelerate and brake with a joystick or other controls, so it\u2019s like you are driving, but you aren\u2019t.  You\u2019d control the robot, and the robot would control the car.  If you wanted to be super safe, you could build an extra sensor in the car that would only drive in the safest conditions, and when there were hazards, or if the car sensed the driver wasn\u2019t doing what they should, then the robot would actually take over control of the car and drive it instead.  This is the safer way, but it would also be kind of slow because the robot would just be doing the exact same thing that you would have done, and if you messed up, the robot would also mess up.\n\nThe other way is to give your car a super powerful computer, with artificial intelligence, and a pretty fast internet connection, and let it drive itself.  This car would also have some sensors, but it wouldn\u2019t really need them, because it would always have access to so much more information than you do.  When you are driving, you would choose where you want to go, and your car would use all of its data to come up with the best route and way to get there.  The computer would make all the decisions about how to handle unexpected events and road conditions, and would do the braking and steering and everything.  It\u2019s kind of like having a flying car that is in control of everything, and you just decide where you want to go.  Most people use cars like this, because they\u2019re pretty good and most of the time you don\u2019t really want to do all of that work and risking making a mistake.", "i_reject": "Can you describe how an autonomous car works?", "r_reject": "The safety of autonomous cars is a very controversial topic right now.  As a car moves along a road, it\u2019s constantly receiving information from its sensors: can it see nearby traffic, or other road users?  And it\u2019s constantly receiving information from its GPS system: what is the speed limit in this location, where are the red lights?  And it\u2019s always making decisions: how fast should it go?  Does it have the right-of-way?  The driver is an important part of all of this decision-making, but it\u2019s one of the most challenging areas of technology.  Autonomous cars are often compared to flying an airplane, where you just get on and have your fun, and there\u2019s a crew in charge.  The computers do the hard work of flying.  But you can\u2019t just look at something and tell if it\u2019s safe to drive.  There\u2019s always a tradeoff.  For example, we can take a picture of an intersection and see how many cars have stopped there at different times, and then estimate how many cars are likely to arrive in the future.  But no image will ever be able to tell you exactly how many cars will be in an intersection at any given time, because each car is in motion, and each driver is different and can change his or her mind in the moment.  In the end, the computer is probably making hundreds of judgments, some of them simple, and some of them incredibly complicated.  And humans make judgments too.  That\u2019s why the driver needs to be paying attention, and must still be able to see clearly, and still must have his or her own ideas about what to do."}

After each state has voted, the candidate with the most electoral votes is declared the winner of that state, even if the candidate didn\u2019t receive the most popular vote.", "i_reject": "How was the presidential victory of Donald Trump decided over Hillary Clinton?", "r_reject": "There are a lot of individual factors that lead to this result, but I\u2019ll just use a simplified model to explain the most important ones.  This model shows how much each vote is worth in a typical presidential election, weighted by which states are used to decide which candidate wins, which state\u2019s vote is worth more than others, and also how likely people are to vote.  For example, a majority of votes in Ohio would be worth more than a majority of votes in Wyoming, since there are more people who vote in Ohio.  Also, in a race where more people vote in one place than another, the number of votes is weighted more than votes from places where fewer people vote.  The model also includes a factor for the likelihood that people vote, since that is very important in determining the outcome of an election.  In this simplified model, a voter\u2019s importance to an election is given by the ratio between the number of votes that person cast and the number of people in their state, and a weight of their vote is given by this number divided by the number of votes in the whole country.  \n\nThere are also other factors, like how a state chooses its electors and how many votes it has in the Electoral College.

But \u201cshonen\u201d anime is more similar to Western animation in the way it portrays adolescent characters and teenaged conflict.

I\u2019m going to share with you some helpful guidelines on keeping a cat healthy:\n\nMake sure she eats well.  Talk with your vet about what is a good diet, and whether your cat should be supplemented with vitamins.  A well-fed cat is less likely to get sick.\n\nGive her regular veterinary checkups.  Every six months you should have her examined by a veterinarian.  To catch diseases early, before they become a problem, have a full checkup.  \n\nGet her microchipped and vaccinated.  A microchip is like a permanent ID tag for pets.  All cats are required by law to be microchipped and vaccinated before they can enter homes.  Microchips cannot be found unless a special scanner is used.  To find one nearby, try searching \u201cmicrochip\u201d on your phone.  Once she has been microchipped, make sure to keep your contact information on file with the clinic that did the microchip, and update the contact information annually.  If she gets lost and the chip is scanned, the clinic can then contact you.  \n\nKeep her inside.", "i_reject": "I just adopted a stray cat and I'm wondering what sort of vet checkups I may need to do to make sure the cat is healthy.", "r_reject": "I\u2019m really not an expert in animal care, but I can tell you that adopting a pet is like starting any new relationship, and you\u2019re essentially learning a new person as you get to know one another.

Here\u2019s another example: \u201cMalaria is a disease caused by a parasite. The parasite is a microscopic organism, not a bacterium or virus, and it is spread by the bite of infected female mosquitoes. If the parasite enters the body, it makes you sick.

Make sure to mix well.  Then take a piece of plastic wrap and shape it into a \u201clong rectangular box\u201d.  Mix the veal and crumb mix in it, and roll it up lengthwise (so the length is now greater than the width).  Place it seam side down in the refrigerator.  In a shallow bowl, mix the flour with the chili powder and salt and pepper.  Set it aside.  In a non-stick pan, heat the olive oil to a moderate temperature.  Once it's hot, carefully remove the roll from the plastic wrap and quickly toss it in the flour mixture.  Use a frying basket if you have one, otherwise just carefully turn it over so the seam side is down.  Once browned on both sides, serve with a simple oil and lemon vinaigrette, and of course, eat it all.\n\nI also found a recipe on cooking.com that said:\n\nThinly slice a veal cutlet lengthwise. Combine egg yolks, parsley, lemon juice, dry mustard, salt, and pepper. Spread slices with mustard mixture. Roll up, and fasten with toothpicks. Cover with milk and sprinkle with breadcrumbs.

It is similar to the French dish steak au poivre, but different.

It\u2019s common to see it in the South-Eastern states, especially in Louisiana, where Cajun and Creole cooking are popular.  In many cases, the West African flavors are much more subtle, and their main influence comes from the preparation of vegetables and other foods, which use some of the same cooking methods as West African cuisine.  It\u2019s possible that this is because many Creole families left West Africa for the Americas on slave ships, so the food traditions of their ancestors were part of their cultural background.  So the main thing you\u2019ll see with Creole cooking is a lot of spicy flavors, especially from the French and Spanish colonization of the New World.

Then, you might be able to make a plan for what they\u2019ll do, that\u2019s similar to their favorite thing but that requires a little more manual dexterity.  For example, if the children like to play video games, you could arrange a project that they complete by hand, but is equivalent to a video game.

To complicate matters further, according to Bill Fries, Jackson composed \"Chicken Fried\" independently in the 1950s, but credited Banks with the song when it was recorded with the \"weird spellings and a hokum meter\" to make it appear to be an old blues number. When Fries spoke with Banks, Banks confirmed that Jackson had asked him to help with the lyric, but said Jackson later took full credit for the lyrics.\n\nHere\u2019s an alternative explanation: \n\n\"Chicken Fried\" (sometimes listed as \"Chicken Fried\") is an American song written by the co-writers Raymond Jackson and Homer Banks.

{"i_chosen": "Why does meat dry out in the freezer after a while?", "r_chosen": "Well that\u2019s a tricky one, humans! It turns out that you don\u2019t actually freeze the meat, you only cool it down.  Meat still contains proteins and enzymes, and the proteins and enzymes aren\u2019t affected by temperature, but they are affected by \u201ccrystallization\u201d \u2013 when the cold liquid water in the meat becomes a solid.  It\u2019s this crystallization that causes the meat to dry out.  On the other hand, if you freeze the meat, you freeze all the liquid, which prevents the crystallization from taking place, and the meat never dries out.  If you want to freeze meat without it drying out, you can put it in the fridge before you freeze it.", "i_reject": "Why does meat dry out in the freezer after a while?", "r_reject": "The two most likely reasons are that the meat has lost its moisture, and that the surface of the meat has grown dry and cracked.  This happens more in wet climates, where the moisture gets wiped out of the meat."}
