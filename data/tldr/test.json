I hope this isn't too trivial of a question to ask on here, but I've been feeling a bit out of my depth when it comes to this situation (I've had only one relationship before, and for many reasons, it was out of the ordinary).\n\nOkay! So, a couple of weeks ago, I started talking to this guy on Facebook, through a student group that we were both part of. I thought he was sort of cute, so I sent him a PM just to talk, etc, etc. We're both transfer students at the same school, so I knew that we could eventually meet in person once we both moved on-campus. So, we did, and we hung out maybe twice, just as friends.\n\nOkay. So, everything is going pretty well. We talk over Facebook and Snapchat, whatever. So, Saturday night, I was just hanging out with people and kind of being bored, when I got a Snapchat from him asking what I was doing. I asked if he wanted to hang out, so we did. \n\nWe ended up smoking pot (the first time for me, ever), and sort of just wandering around. Eventually we ended up back at his dorm room, where high me decided to just go for it, and I came on to him pretty strongly. It worked out for me (luckily, otherwise things would have been really super awkward), and we ended up messing around but not having sex.\n\nYesterday, however, I ended up going to hang out with him again, and this time we did sleep together. Afterward, we kind of discussed what we were going to do, and he just said that he wanted to \"play it by ear\" and not slap any labels on anything. I'm wondering if this means that he wants a fwb-type situation, or if he might actually be interested in me. The way I've been acting is extremely out of character for me, and I am not interested in having a fuck buddy. I like him, and I would be very interested in maybe seeing where things go, but I'm worried that I may have ruined my chances of a relationship by sleeping with him already.", "gold_response": "I really like this guy, but after having sex with him after only knowing him for a very brief period of time, I am worried that I may have ruined my chances of a relationship with him."}

My father is also the pastor of said church so bringing up our displeasure would cause a lot of drama we would prefer to avoid, if possible.

Her father, though, has always been odd and reluctant to talk to me let alone include me in what they do. This may just be a fatherly defense mechanism, so it should be taken with a healthy dose of my favorite seasoning.\n\nRecently, my IG account was set to open. She liked a photo, which was a good sign. That's all, though. About 2 weeks later, I grew a pair and followed her. Since then, she hasn't responded in any way. It should be noted I tried making my profile private, as an attempt to try to draw her in. So far this has been unsuccessful, and instead of paying attention to me, someone she somewhat knows, she follows douchbags. Along with that, I've developed friendships with a few of her female friends, and I didn't experience any reluctance. \n\nSO...observations? Comments? Thoughts? Chuck Testa?

There have been many many nights where I just lay there frustrated until 2 in the morning listening to him snoring.

I have neither. As a result we're always hanging out with his friends and going to visit his family.. but never mine. I know they're not as great as his, but they are still important people in my life that I would like to continue a relationship with. \n\nOn the topic of sex - He doesn't come on to me really, ever. Once in a blue moon he will, but I initiate for the most part and I get shut down more often than I think is fair. I understand if his sex drive isn't as high as mine, but it does make me feel insecure. \n\nSo to wrap it all up, I do love my boyfriend.

I'm positive he'd never physically cheat, so it never bothered me. \n\nThis morning I went to plug in his phone and make sure he had an alarm set (as I usually do for him in the morning).

I didn't scroll up to see more because that felt like snooping, but what was on the screen was basically along the lines of \"I miss you, and I wish we could still be together\".

I even flat out asked one day after such a talk if he felt I was just the next best thing because he couldn't have them. He reassured me that wasn't the case and has shown me he cares for me. \n\nNow I understand I could be misinterpreting. Things are a bit rough right now for him (job changes, extreme financial stress, etc) and probably the pressure is making him miss happier/simpler times in his life, which they would be part of, so I don't want to approach this from a place of anger. \n\nIs it fair to ask him to cut back on his communication with them so he can stay focused on the present? How can I approach him about being more open about what he's feeling and encourage him to use me as his support base instead of them?

Vet was honest, she didn't know exactly what it was from the x-rays, so they were sent to a radiologist/specialist for review as what she did see was a bone mass density difference between his two hips. Radiologist confirmed same thing, and I was told Cheshire has a condition which is leading to the deterioration of the ball/cap on his leg bone, putting him in massive amounts of pain. Even with the pain killers the vet gave us for the time being, he still growls and limps every time he stands up and walks around.

My mom was pretty much my dad's first everything. They met at work when he was 17, married when he was 21. They didn't have the typical go on some dates/courtship thing, it was more like instant relationship. She did everything for him and I wondered how he was going to manage, but he's making do.\n\nMy dad is an introvert through and through, and he has that sort of self-deprecating humor or view of himself; he knows he's not Brad Pitt or a fascinating conversationalist. If he's not at home in front of his computer, he's at his one close friend's house hanging out or riding his motorcycle if it's nice outside. He still has my two sisters (24 and 13) living at home.\n\nSince early in the year he's been talking about dating, which to me seems a bit soon but that's not for me to decide I guess. He was talking to a woman he works with for awhile; they and another male coworker would get lunch often, and he would casually bring up going out sometime but she would always giggle and do the \"oh yeah, maybe\" thing - at least from what he said, that's my impression. After awhile he kind of got the message that she wasn't all that interested - they still go to lunch but without the talk of going out.\n\nI'm not sure how to best support him in this. A few months ago he asked for my (middle) sister's and my help with setting up an online dating profile and I haven't broached the topic with him since. I want to help him be happy but I'm not sure what to do. Honestly it scares me a little to think of him out on a date knowing it's probably one of the most uncomfortable things for him to do - in the way that I imagine a parent is scared for their child to go to school, maybe. Supporting my friends dating feels totally different than this situation - what can I do?", "gold_response": "My super introverted dad is a widower of just over a year and wants to date again; I'm not sure how to help or support him."}

But my dad and his family (remarried) want to do all this stuff for my birthday.\n\nI have tried before telling them that I don't want to do anything. I just want to sit at their house, grill out, hang out, watch a movie and maybe eat cake. I don't want anything special.\n\nMy dad and his family threw a party for me over the weekend with all my relatives that live nearby. Okay, cool, I can dig it. It wasn't anything special, and there was no cake. Even better.\n\nYesterday I got a phone call saying that we're going out to dinner tonight, and to look nice, yada yada. Good thing I didn't have plans to sit at home and binge watch Breaking Bad with my boyfriend.\n\nMy dad then went into guilt trip mode and told me all about how he was looking for the perfect gift for me and went to eight different stores to get it. I'm not the sort of person who likes getting gifts.\n\nI'm assuming that there's going to be another get together this upcoming weekend too, disguised under 'my birthday' party.

The lease was accepted, I paid my deposit, and I paid my rent. \n\nRecently, the landlord tried to get me to move into a different location (sent an addendum to the lease detailing it) because of his alleged concerns due to a probation-esque sanction from the past and a possible violation that would not allow us to live there. This violation will *not* cause us to be evicted as he originally thought. However, during the time that he thought we would be evicted, due to not understanding the agreement and *not* due to the local government changing their mind later, he gave leases out to new tenants. \n\nWhen we figured this out we were upset and tried to figure out what was going on, while telling the landlord that we would not sign the addendum to move into a different location. Today, I got an email from the landlord saying that the window of time to negotiate had come and gone in the spring (at that time, we didn't even know he was giving new tenants leases, moving us out, or even thought he had any concerns of eviction that would lead him to do so) and the location was rented to a different tenant. He said he \"sincerely believed\" that moving us out (to avoid the eviction, which was never going to happen) was for our own good as a fraternity, and that he has entered into a contract at the new location and considers that he is meeting his obligation to us.\n\nThe other house is owned by a different fraternity who are currently having their own issues. The rental permit for it is currently suspended and only by entering a restrictive agreement with the local government can they even rent it to *anyone*. They themselves cannot move in until 3 years from now but will undoubtedly move in immediately at that time. We also have no guarantee of any other housing, including our own house, after that time, which kinda sucks a lot for a fraternity.\n\nDo I have any way of staying in the original house?", "gold_response": "Signed my lease and paid my rent.

Barely talked to me (we went with two of his friends, a guy and his fianc\u00e9e). I paid for a lot of our food and such because I wanted him to have a good time. I even bought him a jersey as a gift. He was thankful but still aloof. \n\nAfter the game we went back to his friends' house to hang out for a while. Around 11:30 I asked to come back home since we had been up til 4am the night before and I am now pretty sick with a cold. He seemed irritated and made me wait another hour. \n\nThis morning he got up again at 8 and left to go watch soccer with his same friend, so I've been laying here trying to not be sick. \n\nI guess I feel disappointed. I'm not asking for much. I didn't want a gift and I didn't have a problem going to the game or hanging out with his friends...

He can't pinpoint why it happens or really comprehend/integrate explanations when they're given.

From my tattoo artist who is now a competitive bodybuilder to my SO when we started this journey, it has been a consistent cause of frustration for me, as these terms- as well as constitutional psychology in general- has been discredited for years.\n\nConstitutional psychology was developed by a psychologist named William Herbert Sheldon in the 1940's. He asserted that the human body could be split up into three \"somatotypes\"- the endomorph, ectomorph, and mesomorph. He wrote a book on the topic in the 50's called *Atlas of Men*. Each somatotype was characterized as representing a different temperament, level of intelligence, and overall value. It had/has foundations in racism and antisemitism. \n\nThe three types were described as follows (from Wikipedia): \n\nEctomorphic: characterized as linear, thin, fragile, lightly muscled, flat chested and delicate; described as cerebrotonic inclined to desire isolation, solitude and concealment; and being tense, anxious, restrained in posture and movement, introverted and secretive.\n\nMesomorphic: characterized as hard, rugged, rectangular, athletically built with well developed muscles, thick skin and good posture; described as somatotonic inclined towards physical adventure and risk taking; and being vigorous, courageous, direct and dominant.\n\nEndomorphic: characterized as round and soft with under-developed muscles and having difficulty losing weight; described as viscerotonic enjoying food, people and affection; having slow reactions; and being disposed to complacency.\n\nI just wanted everyone to recognize that though it would be very convenient to have this wonderful defiance of the laws of thermodynamics to excuse the inability or lack of desire to lose weight, they have long since been disproven and to use these terms is intellectually dishonest.

It's to the point that we have to warn our friends in advance that she might *try* to sleep with them.\n\nAm I over-reacting or is she sort of out of line here? I spoke to my best friend about it and she agreed that Sara is being a bit disrespectful, but we are not sure if this is just because we aren't too familiar/comfortable with the swinger lifestyle.

We use an internal messaging application software at work which has been great for communicating with other teammates. A lot of us have started using it to complain about things we are not happy about at work. Doing some research after a few got worried, we looked into the privacy policy. We found out that the one on one chats where not accessible by the company, unless they asked the 3rd party and had good reason to have access. That being said, there was nothing that bad to warrant that, so we continued to use it to complain to each other.\n\nThis leads me to today where just as I am about to go home my manager calls me in to a private meeting looking really upset. Then they mentioned the program name and that they had received an email, and suddenly I realized I had fucked up.\n\nOne of the quirks of this program is that when someone is offline it emails them the message. A recently ex co-worker is still active on the chat for quick questions for the next 2 weeks. They came online so we started having a conversation, then another co-worker walked up to me for a chat who has been having a rough week and complained about our boss. When they finished their rant, I then messaged my ex co-worker that my boss wasn't popular with the staff at the moment as that was the second minor complaint I had heard that week. They had gone offline, so an email was sent to their old work email. Past employees emails get sent to the boss, in case important emails are sent to them. \n\nSo after the meeting I still have my job. I had an awkward conversation with my boss and I feel really bad, because my boss is a really nice person that I enjoy working with.

Last night he couldn't sleep and told me he was really hating it and was unsure what he wanted to do with his life. \n\nAs a back story, my boyfriend has depression. He plays a lot of video games, and when he sees his friends (who don't go to college or have jobs), they play games too. Now, I don't have a problem with this, I too play games, sometimes with him as well. I don't mind this hobby he has, but sometimes it feels like it takes priority over school. \n\nWe talked through it last night and I told him I would support him 100%, no matter what he decides. He sais the idea of maybe doing IT would interest him, and I said that sounds like a great idea. He plans on talking to his family about it, so he can have their opinion. \n\nNow, I know in my heart I will support him no matter what, but I'm worried. He doesn't really have anything he's super passionate about, and I'm a very driven person. I plan on going to university to study business, with aspirations to open my own shop front. He doesn't have this drive - but I believe he has the potential to. \n\nWhat I'm asking now, is what do you guys think about the video game situation? Should I talk to him about it?

I'm well aware there are a lot of books geared towards people in their mid-20s, as well as those geared towards paying off student loan debt, but I don't think there's something in the middle that deals with a blend of the two\u2014young, anxious about loans, but eager to start investing.\n\nThus, I'm using my own personal experiences (27M, lawyer) to write a personal finance book that sorts out everything I've learned thus far. The goals of my book are as follows:\n\n(1) Stress financial behavior and personal finance basics rather than super crazy tricks of the trade.\n\n(2) For college kids: discuss how to keep student loan debt down and keys to finding a job.\n\n(3) For recent grads: reducing fixed costs, picking the right student loan repayment plan, balancing investing with student loans, etc.\n\n(4) Basics of investing (401k, IRAs, etc.)\n\n(5) Ultimately, make everything easy so those in my generation have the confidence and ability to have a healthy financial life.\n\nThat's the extremely basic outline thus far. I've written chapters 1-3 and it seems to be coming along pretty well, but I figured I should reach out to /r/personalfinance and see if anybody had some input.\n\nSo what would you stress? What are some things I might be taking for granted? What are unique challenges a 20 year old faces now versus a 20 year old in 1990? Etc.", "gold_response": "Writing a PF book geared towards balancing student loan debt with investing, as well as saving and setting up a plan. What are some things I might be overlooking?

We both attend university, and are both in the same classes. We met about 6 months ago, at the first sight I thought she was beautiful. We started talking more and more in class and it was going great, come to find out she has a boyfriend! I was devesated, I started to have some legit feelings for this girl! Through more conversation I have found out that she is in an abusive relationship. The past few weeks we have been getting even closer then before, you have to realize i see this girl 4 days a week for 6 hours straight. Is she trying to hint that maybe she likes me to? Maybe she wants out of her abusive relationship? Or am I just having some wishful thinking. Lately she has been more touchy towards me, touching my elbow when we talk and laugh playing footsies. So am I crazy? Is there a chance she could like me?", "gold_response": "I like a girl in my class, found out she has a boyfriend, found out its abusive. We got closer. Could she like me?"}

Doctors hypothesized it was undeveloped due to being born premature. I recently went to the optometrist to get a new prescription (for my left eye... no change yay!). She checked behind my eye, and said the eye is healthy up to the point where you get to the nerve, and it's all pale (dead).  \n\nI asked if something like stem cells could repair the nerve (or a bionic eye in the future) and she informed me that after the age of 10, the brain does not develop the eye portion anymore. Thus even with repair, my brain could not process the info.\n\nI would like other opinions on this... I have heard stories of experimental cameras and artificial limbs being attached, and giving back sight or movement. Is my eye problem shit out of luck? \n\nI still have about 5% or so of vision, but it is hard to focus since the left eye overpowers it greatly (even with the eyelid closed). If I close it, it's as if I was \"thinking\" the image, being overlayed on the blackness of the left eye (well.. more to the right). The vision doesn't seem bad (just blurry since there is no prescription on the right lens), but I have to concentrate real hard, and barely can keep the eye focused on one spot. So would this be enough development to regain sight or would it stay the same?", "gold_response": "Nerve is dead in right eye, was told even repairing it would not restore vision.

I'm scared that this is all some big joke (which it isn't, but I cannot get past that thought), i'm scared that she is just bored and lonely and wants a passing fling/easy fuck, i'm scared that I like this girl too much already and since I don't have relationship experience I'm going to fuck it up and ruin it.\n\nWe talk about my insecurities, and hers, and she understands that this relationship stuff is new to me and that i'm kinda learning as I go along.
